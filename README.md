Vehicle detection plays an essential part in an intelligent transportation method, especially in the business operation process. It's the process of automatically relating vehicles in an image or videotape. As we look toward the future of vehicle detection in independent driving the most important thing to concentrate on is the accuracy and speed.
YOLO is a target detection algorithm that provides an end-to-end solution for detecting objects in images. Unlike traditional detection methods, YOLO transforms the detection problem into a regression problem. By unifying the classification task and location task in a single network, YOLO is able to predict the location and category probability of objects in a candidate frame directly.
The KITTI dataset (Kitti Vision Benchmark Suite) is a popular benchmark dataset for various computer vision tasks, including object detection, tracking, and depth estimation. It is widely used in the research community as a standard evaluation dataset for autonomous driving and related applications.
Here, first the video that was captured is converted into number of frames and a vehicle detection algorithm called YOLO is used to detect the vehicles in the frames. KITTI dataset is used to evaluate the pre-trained YOLO model.
This code can be implemented in google colab with all the required things stored in your google drive. 
i)The video that need to be converted into frames must be uploaded
ii)Necessary pre-trained YOLO model files must be downloaded and saved to drive.
iii)Kitti dataset images should be there in drive before executing the code.
